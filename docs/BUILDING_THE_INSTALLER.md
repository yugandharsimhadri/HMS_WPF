# Twinkle — building the installer

How to turn the source code into something you can hand to a clinic - either one
self-contained setup file, or a ClickOnce deployment that updates itself.

Handing it over and installing it are a separate job, written up in
[INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md). This document stops when the file exists.

## What you need, once

| | |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | 10 or 11, 64-bit. IExpress, which does the packing, ships with it |
| **.NET SDK 10** | `dotnet --version` should print `10.` or higher |
| **The repository** | Cloned, and it builds — `dotnet build HMS_WPF.slnx` |

Nothing else. No Inno Setup, no WiX, no Visual Studio. The whole thing is one
PowerShell script and a tool Windows already has.

> Visual Studio *is* needed for the ClickOnce route at the end of this
> document, which is the one exception.

## The four steps

### 1. Bump the publish number

Open `src/Pharma.App/Pharma.App.csproj` and change one line:

```xml
<Version>1.0.0.5</Version>
```

It reads **major.minor.patch.publish**. The fourth part is the publish number:
it counts the builds that actually went out to a clinic. Raise it by one every
time you build an installer you intend to hand over, whether or not anything
else about the version changed.

That single field becomes:

- the version in the navigation sidebar, which support asks people to read out,
- the version listed under **Add or remove programs**,
- **the name of the setup file** — `TwinkleHMSSetup-1.0.0.5.exe`,
- the assembly and file version stamped on the executable.

> **Do this before every release.** Two different builds both calling themselves
> 1.0.0 is the fastest way to spend an afternoon on a bug that was fixed weeks
> ago. There is nothing in the build that will stop you.

The sidebar shows the publish number on its own:

```
Version 1.0.0.5
```

That is what a clinic reads out, and it answers *which release are they on*.

The commit it was built from is kept out of the sidebar on purpose — a line of
hex beside the number only invites the wrong half to be read out. It is in
**Help → About** and at the top of every log file, as `1.0.0.5+72dbe37`. Reach
for it when you rebuild a publish number after a quick fix and need to tell two
builds of the same version apart.

### 2. Run the tests

```bash
dotnet test tests\Pharma.Tests\Pharma.Tests.csproj
```

The 240-odd unit tests take about half a minute and cover the pricing, the GST
arithmetic, pack sizes and the data health checks — the parts where a mistake
costs somebody money.

The UI tests are worth running before a release you are actually shipping:

```bash
dotnet test tests\Pharma.UiTests\Pharma.UiTests.csproj
```

They drive the real application through the real screens and take six or seven
minutes. They open and close windows while they run, so leave the machine alone.

### 3. Build the installer

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\make-installer.ps1
```

Two or three minutes, most of it compressing. It prints its progress:

```
1/3  Building the application as a single file ...
     72.9 MB
     version 1.0.0.5
2/3  Writing the package definition ...
3/3  Packing (a 73 MB payload takes a minute or two) ...

Setup file:  C:\HMS\Setup\TwinkleHMSSetup-1.0.0.5.exe  (66.6 MB)
Version:     1.0.0.5  - this is what the clinic will read off the sidebar
```

The version is in the file name, so a folder of setup files stays readable a
year later and nobody hands over the wrong one.

Somewhere other than `C:\HMS\Setup`:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\make-installer.ps1 -OutputDir D:\Handover
```

### 4. Check what came out

Two quick checks, worth the minute they cost.

**The file is about the right size.** Roughly 65–70 MB. If it is a few hundred
kilobytes, the payload did not go in and you have packaged an installer that
installs nothing.

**It contains what it should.** Unpack it without running it:

```bash
"C:\HMS\Setup\TwinkleHMSSetup.exe" /C /Q /T:%TEMP%\check
```

`%TEMP%\check` should hold exactly three files — `TwinkleHMS.exe` at about
73 MB, `install.cmd` and `install.ps1`.

> **Then test it on a machine that is not this one.** A clean PC or a virtual
> machine with no .NET installed and no `C:\HMS` folder. Installing on the
> machine that built it proves almost nothing: everything it needs is already
> there. This is the step that catches a missing runtime, and it is the step
> everybody skips.

## What the script actually does

Worth knowing for the day it breaks.

1. **Publishes the application** self-contained, single-file and compressed. Self-contained
   means the .NET runtime is inside the executable, so the clinic PC needs
   nothing installed first. That is what makes it 73 MB rather than 5.
2. **Throws away everything else** the publish produced — debug symbols, the
   Lato fonts QuestPDF ships as package content, `appsettings.json`. None of it
   is needed beside a single-file build.
3. **Writes an IExpress definition file**, an ini-style `.sed`. IExpress takes
   no arguments; the file is how you talk to it.
4. **Runs IExpress**, which packs the executable and the two install scripts
   into one self-extracting file and sets it to run `install.cmd` afterwards.

`scripts/installer/install.ps1` is the part that runs on the clinic PC: it asks
for administrator rights once, refuses if Twinkle is open, copies the executable
to `C:\HMS\App`, makes the data folders, creates the shortcuts and registers the
uninstaller.

## When the build fails

| What you see | What it is |
|---|---|
| `The string is missing the terminator` | A non-ASCII character got into a `.ps1`. Windows PowerShell reads these as ANSI without a byte order mark, and one em dash in a string stops the file parsing. Keep the scripts plain ASCII |
| `Publish failed` | Build the solution on its own to see the real compiler error — the publish output hides it |
| `TwinkleHMS.exe was not produced` | The publish succeeded but wrote somewhere else. Check `-o` against the staging folder in the script |
| `IExpress did not produce ...` | Usually `TargetName` in the `.sed` pointing at a folder that does not exist. The script creates it, so this means the path is wrong |
| The file is a few hundred KB | The payload was not picked up. Check that the staging folder still held the executable when IExpress ran |
| `being used by another process` | Twinkle is open, or a previous run is still holding the file. Close it |

---

## Signing, when it is worth it

The setup file is not code-signed. On the clinic PC that means:

- "Windows protected your PC" on first run — **More info → Run anyway**,
- the publisher shown as unknown,
- antivirus occasionally quarantining it, since an unsigned self-extracting
  executable is a common false positive.

For one or two clinics, warning people that the message is coming is enough. For
wider distribution, buy a code-signing certificate and sign both
`TwinkleHMS.exe` and `TwinkleHMSSetup.exe` with `signtool`. The warnings stop.

---

## Building it with ClickOnce instead

The other supported route. Worth it for one reason: **it can update itself.**

### Which to use

| | Setup file | ClickOnce |
|---|---|---|
| Files to send | **One** | Three, which must stay together |
| Needs .NET on the clinic PC | No, it is inside | **Yes** — the bootstrapper fetches it, which needs internet that first time |
| Needs an administrator | Yes, once | **No** — it installs per user |
| Desktop shortcut | Yes | **Start menu only** |
| Automatic updates | No | **Yes**, from a shared folder |
| Needs Visual Studio to build | No | **Yes** |

One PC and a pen drive: use the setup file. Several PCs on a clinic network, or
you expect to ship fixes often: ClickOnce earns its extra pieces.

### You need Visual Studio

Not just the SDK. ClickOnce builds `setup.exe` with a task called
`GenerateBootstrapper`, which only exists in the .NET Framework MSBuild that
ships with Visual Studio:

```
error MSB4803: The task "GenerateBootstrapper" is not supported on the
.NET Core version of MSBuild.
```

So `dotnet msbuild` and `dotnet publish` cannot do it, whatever arguments you
give them.

### Build it

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\publish-clickonce.ps1
```

The script finds Visual Studio's MSBuild for you, publishes, and zips the
result so there is one file to send:

```
Published to src\Pharma.App\bin\publish
     Application Files
     setup.exe
     TwinkleHMS.application

2/2  Zipping ...
     version 1.0.0.1
     1 older version(s) in the publish folder left out of the zip

One file to send:  C:\HMS\Setup\TwinkleHMS-ClickOnce.zip  (69.5 MB)
```

From Visual Studio instead: right-click **Pharma.App → Publish → ClickOnceProfile
→ Publish**. Same output, same folder.

`-NoZip` leaves the three pieces loose, which is what you want when publishing
to a shared folder rather than carrying it.

> **`Application Files` keeps every revision you have ever published.** Each one
> is a full copy of the application. Two publishes and the folder holds 330 MB.
> That is correct for a shared folder — a PC part-way through an update still
> needs the version it is coming from — but it is dead weight in a zip somebody
> carries once, so the script packs only the version the manifest points at.
> Delete the folder occasionally if you publish a lot.

### Installing it at the clinic

1. Copy the zip over and **unzip it**.
2. Run **`setup.exe` from the unzipped folder**. Running it from inside the zip
   viewer fails — the files it needs are still zipped, and the error does not
   say so.
3. If .NET 10 Desktop Runtime is missing, the bootstrapper offers to download
   it. **That needs internet on the clinic PC.** On a machine with none, install
   the runtime by hand first, or use the setup file instead.
4. No administrator prompt. It installs per user, under
   `%LocalAppData%\Apps\2.0\`.
5. The shortcut is in the **Start menu** only, under Twinkle Children's
   Hospital. There is no desktop icon — ClickOnce does not make one.

`C:\HMS\DB` is untouched, exactly as with the setup file. The database never
lives beside the program, which is what makes either route safe to re-run.

### Turning on automatic updates

This is the reason to choose ClickOnce, and it is off in the profile today.

In `src/Pharma.App/Properties/PublishProfiles/ClickOnceProfile.pubxml`:

```xml
<UpdateEnabled>True</UpdateEnabled>
<UpdateMode>Foreground</UpdateMode>
<InstallFrom>Unc</InstallFrom>
<PublishUrl>\\clinic-server\twinkle\</PublishUrl>
```

Publish to that share once. Every PC installed from it then checks the share at
launch and updates itself. Publish a fix in the morning and the counter has it
by the afternoon, with nobody carrying anything.

Leave the old versions in `Application Files` when you do this — that is what
they are for.

### Two things to know before you rely on it

- **`appsettings.json` is replaced on every update.** It sits in the versioned
  folder, and an update installs a new one. A clinic that edited its paths would
  lose them. The defaults are `C:\HMS\DB` and `C:\HMS\DBBackup`, so this only
  bites if someone has changed them.
- **The manifests are not signed.** `SignManifests` is `False`, so the same
  unknown-publisher warnings apply as to the setup file.

## Publishing to this machine

`scripts/publish.ps1` installs straight into `C:\HMS\App` on the machine you run
it on and makes a desktop shortcut. For the development PC — not for handover.
