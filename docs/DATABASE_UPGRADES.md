# Twinkle — upgrading a database that is already in use

A version is installed at a clinic. Everything after it has to **add to** that
database, never replace it. A fresh installation still has to get the whole
schema in one go.

Both come from the same mechanism, and it is already in place.

---

## The short answer

**EF Core migrations, which the application already applies at startup.** There
is no separate set of upgrade scripts to run and nothing to remember to execute
in order — that is the whole point of them.

On every launch, `DbBootstrapper.InitialiseAsync` calls `Migrate()`. It:

- reads `__EFMigrationsHistory`, a table inside the clinic's own database, to
  see which migrations that file has already had,
- applies **only the ones it has not**, oldest first,
- writes each one into that table as it goes.

A new PC has no database, so it has no history, so it gets all of them — which
is how "create the whole schema" and "add the two new columns" end up being the
same line of code.

```
Opening the existing database at C:\HMS\DB\twinkle.db.
Applying migrations: 20260729103000_AddCustomerPhone
Backed up before upgrading to 20260729103000_AddCustomerPhone: C:\HMS\DBBackup\pre-upgrade-20260729-103014.db
Database ready.
```

That is in `C:\HMS\Logs` after every launch, and it is the first thing to read
when somebody asks whether an upgrade did anything.

## Making a schema change

### 1. Change the entity

`src/Pharma.Core/Entities.cs`, as normal.

### 2. Add a migration

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddCustomerPhone --project src\Pharma.Data --startup-project src\Pharma.Data
```

`--startup-project src\Pharma.Data`, not `Pharma.App` — the WPF project does not
reference `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`, and the tools stop with
*"Your startup project 'TwinkleHMS' doesn't reference..."* if you point them at it.

Name it after what it does. That name appears in the clinic's log and in their
`__EFMigrationsHistory` for the life of the database.

### 3. Read what it generated

`src/Pharma.Data/Migrations/<timestamp>_AddCustomerPhone.cs`. Two minutes, every
time. You are looking for anything that drops or rebuilds a table when you only
asked for a column — see [SQLite](#what-sqlite-makes-awkward).

### 4. Run the tests

```bash
dotnet test tests\Pharma.Tests\Pharma.Tests.csproj --filter UpgradeTests
```

Five tests, two seconds. They are described below.

### 5. Ship it

Build the installer as usual. The migration travels inside the executable; there
is nothing extra to copy and nothing to run by hand at the clinic.

---

## What the tests behind this actually check

`tests/Pharma.Tests/UpgradeTests.cs`. Worth knowing what they cover, because
before them **nothing tested upgrading at all** — every other test in the
project migrates a file that does not exist yet, so migrations were only ever
exercised as "create everything from nothing".

| Test | What it would catch |
|---|---|
| **Every change to the model has a migration behind it** | An entity changed with no migration added. The column would be missing at the clinic and the application would come up fine, then fail on the screen that uses it |
| **An old database keeps its records when it is upgraded** | The clinic's actual path: a database built by the old version, with a patient in it, gaining new columns. Asserts the patient is still there afterwards and the new columns can be written to |
| **The migrations apply one at a time in order** | A migration that only works when the whole chain runs in one go. A clinic three versions behind takes them one step at a time |
| **Upgrading twice is the same as upgrading once** | Re-running the installer, or opening the application twice, being treated as a special case |
| **A new installation is created at the latest version** | A fresh PC not getting the newest migration |

The first is the one that earns its keep. It is
`dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes`, run somewhere it cannot be
forgotten.

## The backup taken before an upgrade

When there are migrations to apply and a database already exists, the
application copies it first:

```
C:\HMS\DBBackup\pre-upgrade-20260729-103014.db
```

**These are kept for good and are not part of the daily rotation.** Two reasons
the ordinary daily backup was not enough:

- It takes one per day and skips if today's already exists. A clinic that opened
  the application before installing the new version has already spent it.
- Daily backups are pruned to the newest few. The only copy of the old shape
  could be deleted a week later, which is precisely when somebody asks for it.

If a migration fails, the log says so and the file is still there. Recovery is
copying it back over `C:\HMS\DB\twinkle.db` with the application closed, and
reinstalling the previous version.

---

## Rules that keep this working

**Never change a migration that has shipped.** The clinic's database has already
recorded that it ran. Editing it changes what a *new* installation gets and
nothing about theirs, so the two drift apart silently. Always add another one.

**Never delete a migration.** Same reason, and it breaks the chain for anyone
more than one version behind.

**Never call `EnsureCreated()`.** It builds the schema without recording any
history, so the database can never be migrated afterwards. Nothing in this
project uses it and nothing should start.

**Never ship a `.db` file with the installer.** It would overwrite the clinic's
records. The installer copies one executable and nothing else, deliberately.

**Bump `<Version>` in `Pharma.App.csproj` for every release.** Not required by
migrations, but it is how you find out which schema a clinic is on when they ring
up.

## What SQLite makes awkward

SQLite cannot alter a column or drop one in place. When a migration needs either,
EF Core **rebuilds the whole table** — makes a new one, copies the rows across,
drops the old, renames. It works, and it is worth knowing because:

- It is slow on a large table. A clinic with two years of bills will notice.
- A rebuild is where data is silently reshaped if a type changed. Read the
  generated migration.
- Adding a **new nullable column** is the cheap case and needs no rebuild. Prefer
  it where the choice exists.

Adding a `NOT NULL` column to a table with rows in it needs a default, or the
migration fails at the clinic and nowhere else — there are no rows on your
machine to fail against. Either give it a default or add it nullable and fill it
in.

---

## Changing data rather than schema

The seeding in `DbBootstrapper.SeedAsync` only runs when a table is **empty**.
It sets up a new installation and will never touch a clinic that already has
doctors and medicines.

So a data fix for existing installations — correcting a GST rate, repairing bad
rows — is not seeding. Options, in order of preference:

1. **A migration with SQL in it**, using `migrationBuilder.Sql(...)`. Runs once
   per database, recorded in the history like any other. Right for a one-off
   correction.
2. **A repair the user can run and see**, like the existing **Settings → Check
   data health**. Right when the fix needs judgement or ought to be visible.

What not to do is put a data fix in the startup path with a "have I done this
yet" flag of its own. `__EFMigrationsHistory` is that flag, and it already works.

---

## If you ever need the plain SQL

To hand a DBA the script, or to see what an upgrade will do without running it:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations script --project src\Pharma.Data --startup-project src\Pharma.Data --idempotent --output upgrade.sql
```

`--idempotent` wraps each step in a check, so the script is safe to run against a
database at any version. Useful for reading. **Not** how upgrades are delivered —
the application applies its own migrations, and a hand-run script that half
matches is worse than none.
